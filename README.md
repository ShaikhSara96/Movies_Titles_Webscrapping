What is Web Scraping?

Web Scraping is the extraction of data from a website, and in this case, the Python library called Beautiful Soup will be used. The scraper loads the HTML code of the page the user wants to collect data from, then the scraper will either extract all the data on the page or the user will go through the process of selecting the specific data they want from the page. That is done by looking at the websiteâ€™s HTML code and selecting the the specific element or tag that the desired information is in. More on that later.
